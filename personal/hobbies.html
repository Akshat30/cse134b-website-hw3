        <h2>Listening to EDM</h2>
        <p>
          One of my favorite hobbies includes listening to EDM.
          <dfn>EDM</dfn> stands for Electronic I am a big fan of genres such as
          house music, dubstep, and drum and bass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since house music is my favorite genre of music, here are my top three
          favorite house artists, at the moment:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Max Styler</li>
          <li>John Summit</li>
          <li>Odd Mob</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Here is a snippet of a Max Styler song I really like, it is called
          Touch. I have it downloaded as I also like to DJ, and it requires me
          to have audio files downloaded for mixing.
